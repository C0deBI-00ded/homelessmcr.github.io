    <p> Hello and welcome to our site!</p>
    <p> We are two students currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk" > Code First Girls </a>. </p>
    <p> When asked to build a website based upon an issue we are passionate about our thoughts went immediately to this: Homelessness.</p>
    <p>Homelessness is a growing issue in Manchester and we don't believe enough is being done to address it. By donating as little as a couple of pounds we can help homeless people to survive another day. However this doesn't help them in the long-term. More needs to be done. We need to get rough sleepers into housing, rather than just helping them survive on the streets.</p>
    <p>As I'm sure you have noticed the number of people sleeping rough on the streets of Manchester is ever increasing. The City Council of Manchester has reported an increase in the number of people asking them for help by 155%!</p>
    <p>homelessMCR is on a mission to tackle this problem and we hope to be able to eliminate it altogether by the year 2025. However, we can't do this without your support - We won't hit our target unless we have your support.</p>
    <p>On this site, you will find profiles of several homeless people we have interviewed, their location in Manchester as well as facts and figures </p>
